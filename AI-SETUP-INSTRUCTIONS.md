# 🧠 EduMark AI Chat Setup Instructions

## ✅ Status: AI Chat Interface Ready!

Your EduMark site now has a complete AI chat interface integrated into both teacher and student dashboards. Here's how to connect it to your deployed Lambda function:

## 🔧 Step 1: Deploy Your Lambda Function

1. **Upload** your `edumark-lambda-deployment.zip` to AWS Lambda
2. **Create API Gateway** endpoint 
3. **Deploy** and get your API URL (will look like):
   ```
   https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat
   ```

## 🔗 Step 2: Update the API Endpoint

### Option A: Browser Console (Quick Test)
1. **Open EduMark.surge.sh** in your browser
2. **Go to Teacher or Student Dashboard** 
3. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console)
4. **Run this command** with your actual API URL:
   ```javascript
   updateEduMarkAIEndpoint('https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat')
   ```

### Option B: Update the Code (Permanent)
**Edit this file:** `js/edumark-ai-integration.js`

**Find line 12:**
```javascript
this.apiEndpoint = 'https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat';
```

**Replace with your actual API URL:**
```javascript
this.apiEndpoint = 'https://abc123def.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat';
```
